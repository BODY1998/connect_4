# Connect 4 Game

## Description
Connect 4 is a classic two-player connection game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. This implementation features both a player vs. player mode and an AI mode, where players can compete against a computer opponent using sophisticated algorithms.

## Features
- **Two Player Mode:** Engage in a match against a friend.
- **AI Opponent:** Challenge an AI that uses Minimax or Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms to determine optimal moves.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with Tkinter for an intuitive gameplay experience.
- **Dynamic Game State Display:** The current game board updates automatically after each move.
- **Result Announcement:** At the end of the game, the application announces the winner or declares a draw.
